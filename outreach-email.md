**Subject:** Extending CONTEXT-ALIGN to Agentic Architecture

---

Dear Dr. Sterken and Dr. Kirkpatrick,

I read your paper "Conversational Alignment with Artificial Intelligence in Context" with great interest. Your CONTEXT-ALIGN framework and application of Clark's grounding theory to AI alignment addresses something I've been grappling with in practice.

**About me:** I'm VP of Engineering at Huli, a healthcare SaaS company integrating AI into Latin America's healthcare ecosystem. My background includes Senior Principal Architect roles, and I've spent years studying philosophy and psychology informally alongside my technical work. This intersection—practical AI engineering with philosophical grounding—is what drew me to your paper.

Building agentic AI systems has forced me to confront alignment problems daily. I've arrived at an insight that extends your work:

**Your framing:** Conversational alignment is about encoding human conversational norms into AI systems—making them competent, reliable interlocutors.

**The extension:** For agentic AI specifically, conversation isn't just the medium for alignment—it *is* the alignment process. The main agent's primary job should be maintaining the dialogue, not executing tasks. Execution should be delegated to sub-agents while the main agent protects the conversational substrate.

This reframes the architecture question: instead of asking "how do we make AI better at conversation?" we ask "how do we protect conversation from the agent's own task execution?"

The insight synthesizes your work with therapeutic alliance research (the relationship as treatment factor) and servant leadership theory (facilitation as the work). I've written it up here:

I'm reaching out for two reasons:

1. **Feedback:** Does this extension seem theoretically sound? Are there obvious gaps or prior work I'm missing?

2. **Potential collaboration:** I'm interested in developing this further. If you find the direction interesting, I'd welcome the opportunity to collaborate—or at minimum, would be grateful for arXiv endorsement if you think the work merits formal publication.

I understand you're busy, so even a brief response would be appreciated.

Best regards,
